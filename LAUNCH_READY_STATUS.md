## üîê **WORKING SYSTEMS & FEATURES**

### **1. Authentication & User Roles (Production Ready)**
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Auth Integration**: Real user accounts are now created in Firebase Authentication.
- ‚úÖ **Seeding Script**: Creates `super_admin`, `company_admin`, `recruiter`, and `interviewer` roles correctly.

- ‚úÖ **Invitation Flow**: The system for accepting invitations is in place.

### **2. Core Application APIs (Production Ready)**
- ‚úÖ **Jobs API**: `GET /api/jobs` and `GET /api/jobs/[id]` now pull live data from the database, not mocks.
- ‚úÖ **Candidates API**: `GET /api/candidates` and `GET /api/candidates/[id]` now pull live data.
- ‚úÖ **AI Search & Matching**: The API endpoints (`/api/ai/*`) are connected to their respective Genkit flows and use the database.
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard APIs**: New dedicated API endpoints have been created for each user role dashboard, ensuring they receive relevant, live data.

### **3. Frontend User Experience (Production Ready)**
- ‚úÖ **All Dashboards Live**: The dashboards for all user roles (Candidate, Recruiter, Interviewer, Company Admin, Super Admin) now fetch and display real-time data from the backend.
- ‚úÖ **Job & Candidate Lists**: The main pages for browsing jobs and candidates are now connected to the database via their APIs.
- ‚úÖ **Image Placeholders**: Placeholders on the homepage and login page are now configured for AI image generation hints (`data-ai-hint`).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING TASKS & CONSIDERATIONS**

While the platform is ready for launch, some features are still in a foundational state and can be enhanced post-launch:

- **Email Service**: The `emailService` is in place but is configured to log emails to the console in development. For production, you must configure a real email provider (e.g., SendGrid) in your environment variables for emails to be sent.
- **Payment Integration**: The UI for subscription plans exists, but the backend for processing payments (e.g., with Stripe) is not implemented.
- **Real-time Notifications**: The framework for notifications is ready, but a WebSocket or SSE implementation is needed for real-time delivery.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Some dashboard charts and metrics are still using simplified or placeholder calculations. These can be expanded with more detailed data aggregation.
