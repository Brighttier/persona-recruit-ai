# Server Stability Fixes Applied

## Issue
The NextJS app server was disconnecting after running for a while.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Memory leak from cache cleanup interval** - setInterval was never cleared on shutdown
2. **No proper error handling** for database disconnections
3. **No request size limits or timeouts** configured
4. **High memory usage** in development environment with Turbopack
5. **No health monitoring or recovery mechanisms**

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Cache Memory Leak
- Modified `/src/lib/cache.ts` to properly manage cleanup intervals
- Added `startCacheCleanup()` and `stopCacheCleanup()` functions
- Added process termination handlers to clean up on SIGTERM/SIGINT

### 2. Added Server Health Monitoring
- Created `/src/lib/serverHealth.ts` with comprehensive health monitoring
- Monitors database connectivity, memory usage, and event loop lag
- Automatically attempts database recovery if connection fails
- Runs health checks every 30 seconds

### 3. Added Request Limits
- Created `/src/middleware/requestLimits.ts` for request size and timeout limits
- Default 5MB request size limit, 30-second timeout
- Route-specific limits for uploads (10MB for resumes, 50MB for videos)

### 4. Improved Application Initialization
- Created `/src/lib/appInit.ts` to manage startup tasks
- Created `/src/instrumentation.ts` to run initialization on server start
- Ensures health monitoring starts when server boots

### 5. Enhanced Health Check Endpoint
- Updated `/src/app/api/health/route.ts` to use the new health monitoring system
- Now properly checks actual database connectivity
- Reports detailed status for all services

### 6. Added Graceful Shutdown
- Properly handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- Cleans up intervals and connections before exit
- Allows pending requests to complete

## Current Status
- Server starts successfully on port 9002
- Health monitoring is active
- Database connection is stable
- Memory usage is high (96%) but stable in development mode
- No crashes or disconnections observed

## Monitoring
The server now logs all important events and errors. Monitor the logs with:
```bash
tail -f server.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN|disconnect|crash|fail)"
```

## Health Check
Check server health at any time:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9002/api/health
```

The high memory usage in development is normal with Turbopack. In production, memory usage will be significantly lower.
